GARMIN EXTRACT:
Use GarminExtract.py to extract data, GarminVisualisation.py to visualise
Current W.I.P. - extract more data e.g. HRV, deal with 0 RHR recordings appropriately
Would be nice:
    ML Analysis of trends - training load affect on sleep, RHR etc.

STRAVA EXTRACT:
StravaImport.py is initial bones of project. Imports data from user's Strava and creates a simple
graph of recent training volume.

To use, make a text file called "client_info" where line one is client id, line two is client secret, line three is refresh token
and line 4 is your authorisation token, obtained by replacing this link with your information:
https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL&approval_prompt=force&scope=read_all,activity:read_all,profile:read_all
(your callback URL can just be "https://localhost")

"manual access token" - to avoid having to re-obtain authorisation code, once an access code has been obtained, can manually overwrite the access_token variable in this version of file
